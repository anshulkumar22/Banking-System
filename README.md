Banking System
**Overview**
This is a simple banking system implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming concepts. It simulates basic banking functionalities, such as opening an account, checking the balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, closing an account, and displaying all accounts. The data is stored in a file (Bank.data) so that it persists across program executions.

**Features**
Open a new account with an initial balance.
Check account balance by account number.
Deposit money into an account.
Withdraw money from an account, ensuring a minimum balance.
Close an account by account number.
View all accounts along with their details.
Persistent storage: Account information is saved in a file and loaded on subsequent program runs.

**Files**
main.cpp: The C++ source file containing the banking system code.
Bank.data: The file where account details are saved. This file is automatically generated by the program if it doesn't exist.

**Class Structure**
1. Account Class
The Account class represents a bank account with the following properties:
accountNumber: Unique ID for each account.
firstName and lastName: The account holder's name.
balance: The current balance of the account.

**Methods:**
Constructors:
Default constructor: Initializes an empty account.
Parameterized constructor: Creates a new account with given details.
Getters:
getAccNo(): Returns the account number.
getFirstName() and getLastName(): Returns the account holder's name.
getBalance(): Returns the current balance.
Transactions:
Deposit(float amount): Adds the specified amount to the balance.
Withdraw(float amount): Withdraws the specified amount, ensuring the balance doesn't fall below the minimum required (MIN_BALANCE).
File I/O:
Overloaded << and >> operators for file and console input/output.
3. Bank Class
The Bank class manages multiple accounts using a map data structure. The key is the accountNumber and the value is the Account object.

**Methods:**
Constructor:
Initializes the bank by reading existing accounts from the Bank.data file.
OpenAccount(string fname, string lname, float balance):
Creates a new account and saves it in the file.
BalanceEnquiry(long accountNumber):
Returns the details of a specific account.
Deposit(long accountNumber, float amount):
Deposits money into a specified account.
Withdraw(long accountNumber, float amount):
Withdraws money from a specified account, ensuring the balance doesnâ€™t drop below the minimum.
CloseAccount(long accountNumber):
Deletes an account.
ShowAllAccounts():
Displays details of all accounts.
Destructor:
Saves the current state of all accounts to the file upon program termination.


**Program Flow**
Initialization:
When the Bank object is created, it reads from the Bank.data file (if it exists) and loads the accounts into memory.

**User Interaction:**
The program provides a menu with options:
Open an account.
Check balance.
Deposit money.
Withdraw money.
Close an account.
Show all accounts.
Quit the program.

**Persistent Data:**
Every time an account is created or modified (e.g., deposit/withdrawal), the program writes the updated account information back to the Bank.data file.

**Exiting:**
When the program exits, the destructor of the Bank class saves the current state of all accounts to Bank.data so that the data is retained for the next run.
